A simple FAT32 bootloader written in assembly to boot from USB drives.

What this bootloader can do:

It can load the first file( which should be a file less than 4096 bytes) which is located in a USB drive with a FAT32 file
system to the memory and hand over the execution to that program.

Steps to use the Bootloader:

1. Compile the bootloader.
        nasm <path of the bootloader> ­f bin ­o boot.bin
        
2. Unmount the USB device.
        sudo umount <absolute path of the device>
        
3. Format the USB device to FAT32 file system.
        Sudo /sbin/mkdosfs ­F 32 <absolute path of the device>
        
4. Copy the Bootloader to the USB device.
        Sudo /sbin/mkdosfs ­F 32 <absolute path of the device>
        
5. Copy the compiled kernel to the USB device( just as you copy any usual file to the USB
device).

6. Restart the computer and boot from the USB device!.
